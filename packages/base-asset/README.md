# Fuel Base Asset

The contract deployed on the Fuel Network which implements the SRC-20 standard for the base asset, Ether.

## Contract ID

The `ContractId` of the base asset SRC-20 implementation is `0xa20eb159e6460c47f438cb9e9f653a8d5084146ca115c774181c0620608d15a3`. This is calculated using the zero salt (`0x00..00`).

## Asset Id

The `AssetId` fo the base asset SRC-20 implementation is `0xa48cdc6b0bc20843b9a755a6fffc6ff9a0965b1aff0d58cc9247dc72b8bbd61f`. This calculated by taking the SHA256 hash digest of the ContractId and the zero SubId (`0x00..00`) i.e. sha256((contract_id, sub_id)).

## Compiled Output

The compiled output binaries of the base asset SRC-20 implementation is provided in the `/bin` folder and include both binaries and the hex representation of the binaries.
