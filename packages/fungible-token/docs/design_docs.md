## ETH Bridge

The ETH bridge facilitates the transfer of ETH from Ethereum to be represented as the native token on Fuel.

### ETH Bridge Deposit

1. User starts a deposit by calling `depositETH()` on `FuelMessagePortal` which accepts an amount of ETH that gets custody while bridged
1. The Fuel client sees an outgoing message event emitted on the `FuelMessagePortal` and adds a corresponding `InputMessage` to the UTXO set with the designated recipient
1. The recipient can now spend the amount value in the input message like any other input

### ETH Bridge Withdrawal

1. User starts a withdrawal by creating a transaction that creates a `MessageOut` receipt, via the `SMO` opcode, with a specific amount of ETH
1. The `messageId`s from all `MessageOut` receipts in a block are put into a merkle tree and included in the block header, which gets committed to the `FuelChainState` contract
1. After a finalization period, the user calls `relayMessage` on the `FuelMessagePortal` contract with a block inclusion proof that is cross verified with the `FuelChainState` contract, which then sends the ETH to the message recipient

## ERC-20 Bridge

The ERC-20 bridge facilitates the transfer of ERC-20 tokens from Ethereum to be represented as tokens on Fuel.

### ERC-20 Bridge Deposit

1. User starts a deposit by calling the `deposit()` function on the `FuelERC20Gateway` (after they have approved token transfer to `FuelERC20Gateway`)
1. The `FuelERC20Gateway` transfers tokens to itself to custody while they are bridged
1. The `FuelERC20Gateway` creates a message in the `FuelMessagePortal` to be relayed on Fuel with the `MessageToContractPredicate` as the recipient so that anyone can spend the `InputMessage` on the user's behalf but with guarantees that the spending transaction correctly relays the message data
1. The Fuel client sees an outgoing message event emitted on the `FuelMessagePortal` and adds a corresponding `InputMessage` to the UTXO set with the designated recipient predicate
1. A transaction is built and submitted by either the user or a third party that meets the requirements of the `MessageToContractPredicate` recipient
1. A single call is made from the transaction script to the intended target Fuel token contract specified in the messages data field. This function verifies the sender of the `InputMessage`, parses the data from the `InputMessage` data field and mints the appropriate amount of tokens

### ERC-20 Bridge Withdrawal

1. User starts a withdrawal by calling `withdraw` on the token specific `BridgeFungibleToken` contract, sending the coins to withdraw along with it
1. The `BridgeFungibleToken` contract looks to see what coins it was sent, burns them and then creates a `MessageOut` receipt via the `SMO` opcode
1. The `messageId`s from all `MessageOut` receipts in a block are put into a merkle tree and included in the block header, which gets committed to the `FuelChainState` contract
1. After a finalization period, the user calls `relayMessage` on the `FuelMessagePortal` contract with a block inclusion proof that is cross verified with the `FuelChainState` contract, which then calls to the `FuelERC20Gateway` with the abi specified in the message data
1. The `FuelERC20Gateway` verifies itâ€™s being called by the `FuelMessagePortal` and releases the specified amount of tokens to the specified address
