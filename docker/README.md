# Fuel Development Environment

This project runs a local Fuel development environment with both an L1 node and a Fuel node.

## Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose
- make

_Note_: Docker Desktop only allocates 2GB of memory by default, which isn't enough to run the docker-compose services reliably.

To allocate more memory, go to Settings > Resources in the Docker UI and use the slider to change the value (_8GB recommended_). Make sure to click Apply & Restart for the changes to take effect.

## Commands

### Starting containers

To start all containers and build it, use;

```
make up
```

### Stop containers

To stop to containers, use;

```
make stop
```

### Clean containers

```

### View logs

```
make logs
```
